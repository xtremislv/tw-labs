"""
Centralised app configuration.

Everything the app needs to know that varies between "my laptop", "CI", and
"production" lives here and nowhere else — no module should read
``os.environ`` directly. Values come from environment variables (a ``.env``
file in the ``backend/`` directory is auto-loaded for local development; in
production you set real environment variables on your host instead of
shipping a .env file).

See ``.env.example`` for what every setting means and how to obtain it.
