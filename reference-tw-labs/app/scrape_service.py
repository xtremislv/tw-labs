    Scrapes every active channel, one ScrapeRun row per platform attempted.
    ``platform`` restricts to just "youtube" or "instagram" (used by the
    GitHub Actions workflow to run them as separate jobs/steps so a slow
    Instagram batch doesn't delay fresh YouTube numbers, and so a missing
    Apify token doesn't block YouTube scraping or vice versa).

    If the sidebar's "Apify Usage" toggle has paused Instagram scraping
    (WorkspaceSettings.instagram_scraping_enabled, see app/settings_service.py),
    an Instagram request is recorded as a "skipped" ScrapeRun rather than
    actually calling Apify — this is the one choke point every trigger (the
    API-key-protected /run the cron uses, the cooldown-limited /run-manual
    the dashboard button uses, and the in-process scheduler) goes through,
    so the toggle reliably stops Apify spend regardless of what fired the
    scrape. YouTube is never affected by this toggle.
