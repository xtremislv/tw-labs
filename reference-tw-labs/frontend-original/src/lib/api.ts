/**
 * Thin fetch wrapper around the FastAPI backend (see backend/app/main.py).
 *
 * Every type here mirrors a Pydantic response schema field-for-field (the
 * backend's CamelModel produces exactly these camelCase shapes — see
 * backend/app/schemas.py) so App.tsx can treat API responses the same way
 * it used to treat the old hardcoded CHANNELS/VIDEOS mock arrays.
 *
 * API_BASE resolves to:
 *   - "" (same-origin, e.g. "/api/videos") when VITE_API_BASE_URL is unset
 *     — this is what the Docker Compose / nginx setup uses (nginx proxies
 *     /api/* to the backend container) and what `pnpm run dev` uses (Vite's
 *     dev-server proxy in vite.config.ts).
 *   - the full backend URL (e.g. "https://your-api.onrender.com") when
 *     VITE_API_BASE_URL is set at build time — this is what a split
 *     deployment (frontend on Vercel, backend on Render) needs, since the
 *     two are served from different origins.
