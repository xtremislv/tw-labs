"""
SponsorBlock integration (https://wiki.sponsor.ajay.app/w/API_Docs) — a
free, crowdsourced, YouTube-only database of timestamped segments inside
videos: sponsor reads, self-promo plugs, paid "exclusive access" pitches,
and a few purely structural categories (intro/outro/preview/filler/etc.)
this dashboard doesn't care about. This module checks which of a channel's
videos have a commercially-relevant segment, so the dashboard can flag
"this competitor's video is a sponsored/campaign video" without watching
it.

There is no equivalent public database for Instagram, so this only ever
runs from app/scrapers/youtube.py — Instagram videos simply never get a
sponsor check and always read as "no data".

Split the same way as app/scrapers/youtube.py, for the same reason (the
part worth unit-testing shouldn't need the network):
- ``SponsorBlockClient`` — the only thing here that talks to the network.
- ``parse_segments()`` — pure function: raw segment JSON -> a summary.
- ``check_and_store_sponsor_segments()`` — orchestrates the two against the
  DB for a batch of videos, respecting a shared per-run budget so one big
  channel backfill can't burn through SponsorBlock's free API or blow the
  scrape job's time limit (see SponsorCheckBudget below).

Licensing note: SponsorBlock's database is community-contributed and
distributed under its own license, which requires attribution — see the
"Sponsor data via SponsorBlock" credit + link in the dashboard's sidebar
(src/App.tsx). If this dashboard's use ever stops being "an internal tool a
small team looks at" and becomes something redistributed/sold, re-check
https://wiki.sponsor.ajay.app for whether that still fits the license
before relying on this module.
