"""
Early-velocity tracking: judging a brand-new upload against how a channel's
*own* recent videos typically looked at the same age, not just its eventual
lifetime total — see the "h1/h3/h6" columns on ``Video`` in app/models.py.

Deliberately independent of app/overperformance.py's baseline pipeline: this
module never reads or writes ``views``/``avg_views_baseline``/
``overperform_ratio``, only the velocity-specific columns/table, so nothing
here can affect the existing (well-tested) overperformance math. It mirrors
that module's shape on purpose though — a pure "just data in, data out"
function plus a thin DB-facing orchestration wrapper — for the same reason:
the part worth unit-testing shouldn't need a database or the network.

Pieces:
- ``VelocityVideoInput`` / ``VelocityBaselineResult`` / ``compute_velocity_
  baselines()`` — pure function: given every video's per-checkpoint view
  counts (only the checkpoints that have actually been captured), work out
  each video's ratio against a trailing per-(channel implied by caller,
  format, checkpoint) baseline. Same trailing-window/min-videos gating as
  overperformance.py, reusing its settings (``baseline_window_videos`` /
  ``baseline_min_videos``) rather than adding a second set of knobs.
- ``recompute_and_store_channel_velocity_baselines()`` — DB-facing wrapper
  matching ``recompute_and_store_channel_baselines``'s contract (caller
  commits).
- ``capture_velocity_snapshots()`` — the actual hourly job body (see
  routers/scrape.py's POST /api/scrape/check-velocity and .github/
  workflows/hourly-velocity-check.yml): finds YouTube videos that still
  have an open checkpoint window, refreshes their view/like/comment counts
  in one batched ``videos.list`` call, records whichever checkpoint(s) now
  fall inside their grace window, and recomputes velocity baselines for
  every channel touched. A checkpoint whose grace window closes with
  nothing captured is left permanently null — see Settings.
  velocity_checkpoint_grace_hours's docstring — never backfilled later from
  by-then-stale data.

Known Phase-1 limitation: unlike the main scrape (see app/scrape_service.py),
this job does not write a ScrapeRun row, so its (small — well under 50 units/
day, see backend/README.md's quota math) YouTube quota spend doesn't show up
in the sidebar's "API Quota" widget. Acceptable for a backend-only first cut;
worth revisiting if that widget needs to be exact.
