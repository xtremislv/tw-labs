"""
The one piece of "business logic" this whole project has: deciding what a
channel's *normal* view count looks like, so a video can be judged against
it.

Method (deliberately simple and explainable — see PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md for
ideas on making it fancier later):

For each (channel, format) pair — long-form YouTube videos, YouTube Shorts,
and Instagram Reels are tracked as separate baselines, since a channel's
Shorts and long-form videos naturally sit at very different view counts —
sort that channel's videos of that format by publish date. Each video's
baseline is the *trailing* mean views of up to ``BASELINE_WINDOW_VIDEOS``
videos published strictly before it (never including itself, and never
looking into the future). A video needs at least ``BASELINE_MIN_VIDEOS``
prior videos before a baseline is considered meaningful; before that its
``avg_views_baseline`` / ``overperform_ratio`` are left ``None`` rather than
computed from too little data (a brand-new channel's first video would
otherwise trivially "overperform" against an empty baseline).

``overperform_ratio = views / avg_views_baseline``. The frontend's existing
"overperforms" threshold (badge color, notification panel, sidebar badge
count) is ``overperform_ratio >= OVERPERFORM_RATIO_DEFAULT`` (2.0x by
default, configurable via env var) — that's exactly the "crossed a
benchmark" behaviour requested for the dashboard.

Alongside the mean, the same trailing window also gets a **median**
baseline (``median_views_baseline`` / ``overperform_ratio_median``) —
useful because one viral outlier in a channel's recent history drags the
mean up (and so understates how much a new video overperformed), while the
median shrugs it off. The frontend lets viewers toggle which one drives the
ratio shown/sorted-by; both are always computed and stored so that toggle
is instant rather than needing a re-fetch with different math.

This module never talks to the database directly (easier to unit-test) — it
takes plain video rows in, returns updated ones out; the caller
(scrapers/*.py) is responsible for persisting the result.
